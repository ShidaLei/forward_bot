# forward_bot 微信群传话助手
This project aims to forward messages among Wechat group chats automatically. 
(See more about Wechat: http://www.wechat.com/en/) 
Group chat in Wechat has a limitation of 500 people. 
However, sometimes we want more people communicate together in a larger group. 
I developped this robot to forward messages among several group chats automatically. 
In addition, I added a tuling robot to chat with people who side-text the robot.

The name of this robot is Enrique, same as my first pet dog.

在微信群之间传递消息，外加图灵机器人陪聊。
